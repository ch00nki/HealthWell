if u call apis from ur frontend, api keys will be exposed.
The api keys MUST stay server-side
call them here, or a custom backend server like nodejs/fastapi, or firebase functions
Anything under app/api runs on server runtime (Node.js, Edge)

Use FastAPI bcos node.js cant run pytorch/huggingface python models
U can use nodejs as proxy/aggregator/api gateway to act as middle man tho
While AI runs on FastAPI, use Node.js to direct/manage access to the AI

Firebase api key is public as it only identifies project, 
not give unrestricted access, the rules in firebase manage security
In .env, the variable names for firebase keys start with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to
auto expose them to browser, as they need to be accessible in client-side
for firebase initialization
